# Autonomous Car using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

Objectives:

Understanding Data Mining Techniques and Deep Learning
Become familiar with Python, Keras, Tensorflow and OpenCV
Gain experience with research on autonomous vehicle and data mining

# Phase 1: Assembly an Autonomous Vehicle
we are using "SunFounder PiCar-V Kit V2.0 for Raspberry Pi" . We have assembled the the plate withbatter holder,rear motors, wheels , PCB(motor driver, pwm driver, robot hats and raspberry pi), servo for camera, pan & tilt. We have configured VNC viewer to communicate with raspberry pi ans setup cloud account.The assembly pictures are in IMAGES folders

  Steps to improve dmcar:

* The camera clarity could have been more.
* The the circuit to attach and robot HATS could be a bit lengthier in order to avoid accidentlt breaking the circuit.
* The exposed drivers and circuits could have a covering, as the cuicuits and battery wire sometimes interfere with the tire when car moves.
