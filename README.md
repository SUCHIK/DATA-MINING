# Autonomous Car using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

Objectives:

Understanding Data Mining Techniques and Deep Learning
Become familiar with Python, Keras, Tensorflow and OpenCV
Gain experience with research on autonomous vehicle and data mining

# Phase 1: Assembly an Autonomous Vehicle
we are using "SunFounder PiCar-V Kit V2.0 for Raspberry Pi" . We have assembled the the plate withbatter holder,rear motors, wheels , PCB(motor driver, pwm driver, robot hats and raspberry pi), servo for camera, pan & tilt. We have configured VNC viewer to communicate with raspberry pi ans setup cloud account.The assembly pictures are in IMAGES folder
